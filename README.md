# Chi-Square-Test-of-Indenpendence
The chi-square test of independence checks whether two categorical variables are likely to be related or not too each other.

With the test above SPSS(statistical package for social sciences) was used for the Analysis, to check whether a student reading Bsc or BA is dependent on the gender of the student.

There was a sample of 218 students from 12 universities in Ghana, the universities includes KNUST, UDS, UG, ATU, CU etc

Each student's data was taken including age, gender, program-type and school 

# Hypothesis

There will be two hypothesis here the null hypothesis and the Alternative Hypothesis

# Null hypothesis; 

H_0 : There is no relationship between the Gender and program-type OR Program-type is independent on Gender

# Alternative Hypothesis;

H_1: There is a relationship between gender and Program-type OR Program-type is dependent on Gender

# Confidence Level(95%) or Alpha_value=0.05

With a confidence level of 95% meaning we are 95% certain that Gender is independent of Program-type or alpha_value=0.05 means we are 5% not certain that Program-type and Gender are not independent

# Rejection Critiria
We will use the concept of small p_value reject (SPR) and Big P_value Accept (BPA)

 P_value < Alpha_value: Reject the NUll hypothesis

p_value > Alpha_value : accept the Null hypothesis

From the analysisthe  P_Value=0.176  and Alpha_value= 0.05

since the (p_value=0.176) > (Alpha_value = 0.05) we fail too reject the Null hypothesis

# conclusion 
We therefore conclude that program-type and Gender are not dependent on ecah other, meaning astudent reading either BSc or BA is not dependent on the Gender
